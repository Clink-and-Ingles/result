# result
A C++ implementation of the Rust result crate

# Description
This is a header only library that provides all the same functionality of the rust's
`Result<T, E>` type.
Care was taken to enable certain program patterns as well, such as being able to collect
`Result`s into a vector easily.
The C++ standard we use is C++20
